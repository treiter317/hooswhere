The following project was a 12 week project completed in a group of 5 during a UVA computer science course.

The project utilized the Django framework which was new to me and learned throughout the process. The project was formerly hosted on Heroku and implemented
the google maps API; however both of these dependencies have been discontinued after the completion of the course. The application worked as a form of game, 
where users could play a daily challenge of guessing a location of an image somewhere on UVA campus. Points wer then awarded for the proximity to the answer. 
There was also the opportunity to submit challenges that other players would see in the future. Additionally, there was a seperate interface for Admin users 
which involved approving submissions, monitoring existing users, and seeing upcoming challenges.

My primary contributions to this project were:
  - front end development of the entire admin interface
  - process of admin approval and feedback being receieved by user on their end (full-stack)
  - implementation of AWS S3 buckets for cloud image storage
  - lots of general front-end tune ups via Bootstrap
